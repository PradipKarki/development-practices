This document identifies CWDS Testing standards in an effort to help improve software quality and have common standards across development teams. The project comprises of several vendors with different testing philosophies and standards which can cause confusion among teams that interact. A common testing strategy helps set testing expectations among all team members.

# Standards
Developers are responsible for testing there code. All code must be tested and typically will include multiple tests. Planning must take into account testing and code is not complete until tests are complete.

* **Unit Tests**: All Code should have Unit Test. Code should have nearly 100% code coverage.
* **Functional/Acceptance Tests** All Major functionality should include Functional/Acceptance tests. Tests should include normal execution paths and some error handling.
* **Cross Browser Tests** When creating Functional and Acceptance tests, all major supported browsers should be targeted. This includes current versions of IE, Chrome, and Firefox.
* **ADA Tests** ADA tests include manual and automated tests. Developers should check for ADA issues manually prior to completing story. Any tests that can be automated should be,
* **Smoke Tests** Smoke tests should check key areas of an application to ensure app is working correctly. These should be some sort of limited tests which may include functional or acceptance test or other tests to check functionality.
* **Performance Tests** Performance tests are created during performance testing. Tests should mirror Functional and Acceptance tests as well as any other cases identified.
#Unit Testing
Unit testing tests are the primary testing artifacts for testing code components. It allows for testing all aspects of code. CWDS standards are to write unit tests for all code. Please see the Unit Testing Standards document for more detailed information.
